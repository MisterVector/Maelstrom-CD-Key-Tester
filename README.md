# Maelstrom CD-Key Tester

This is a program designed to test multiple CD-Keys using both SOCKS4 and HTTP proxies. It is designed not
to over-use proxies resulting in early proxy death. It can also test both regular and expansion keys for
Warcraft III and Diablo II.

# What is this extra/ doing in .gitignore?

The reason that .gitignore has an entry called `extra/` is so you can create a folder called "extra" in your
own local git repository with its own content that you don't want to be a part of the repository as you may
want to create tools that can assist your development or store project assets.
