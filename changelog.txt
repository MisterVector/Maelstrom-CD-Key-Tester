Version 4.3.1 - Released on December 10, 2020

  - The changelog was missing the changes for version 4.3.0

Version 4.3.0 - Released on November 29, 2020

  - Potentially fixed a small issue when getting rejected by SOCKS4 proxies
  - Small improvement when loading proxy files
  - Added support for 26-digit Diablo II keys
  - Implemented SOCKS5 proxy support
  - Clicking and moving the main form around is now possible when clicking the
    Reload Proxies, Reload CD-Keys and Config labels
  - When reloading proxies, existing proxies are removed from the active sockets
  - If loading in keys by dumping a series of folders in the CD-Keys folder and
    any of the subfolders contains the files W2BN.txt, D2DV.txt or D2XP.txt, none
    of those files would be deleted
  - Fixed an issue where some proxies won't get the correct Battle.Net IP
    from Maelstrom when connecting
  - Fixed an issue where the number of hours since testing started would not be
    calculated correctly in certain cases
  - Slight performance tweak when determining when to clear the text screen
  - Removed broken Warcraft III support
  - Dropped CheckRevisionMPQ.dll and updated VersionCheck.dll to be used instead for
    Diablo II CD-Key testing. This should also get rid of the version out of date
    errors encountered when testing Diablo II CD-Keys as this should be more
    up to date
  - Added support for displaying days in time elapsed
  - The updater now uses the Code Speak Distribution System to check for a new
    update. When you click the "Yes" button to indicate you want to update, you
    will now be taken to the Code Speak website with a special page showing the
    changes since your version and the latest
  - Updated Binaries/READ THIS.txt including a new URL
  - Updated the default BNLS server to jbls.davnit.net
  - The libbnet.dll library has been dropped as BNCSUtil.dll has replaced it

    pop up specifying that there are errors and to correct them before clicking
    OK again
  - Updated the readme for new changes and some fixes
  - Fixed an issue where changing the "sockets per proxy" setting in the configuration
    had no immediate effect
  - Reversed a change from Maelstrom 4.2.0 that treated the "Hashes for W2BN are too new"
    issue as coming from certain Warcraft II keys. This is incorrect, and instead the
    socket that produced this error is reconnected
  - Update check will be disabled if Maelstrom is loaded by the Code Speak Distribution System

Version 4.2.3 - Released on February 15, 2019

    - Spaced version notes to be more consistent and readable
    - Changed "Last modified on" to "Released on" to be more accurate
  - Updated the readme

Version 4.0 - Released on August 2, 2016

  - The count for CD-Keys tested for all products and result types cut off past 999
  - Removed mention of Clan CODE on program load
  - Updated the version bytes for the latest product versions
  - Replaced static gateway IPs with DNS resolution so that future Battle.Net gateway
    IP changes won't interfere with Maelstrom
  - Fixed diablo II hashing that was broken by the diablo II update in march 2016
    using CheckRevision.dll, a modified version of Warden.dll by Hdx
  - Altered the program title a bit
  - All message boxes now only show the OK button and have the full program title
  - The "Total" section on the GUI now shows the total count of the CD-Keys of that product
    that will be tested
  - Added a percent section to the GUI to show the current testing percentage of each CD-Key
  - Changing the amount of sockets, reconnect time, and check failure time may be done
    even after Maelstrom has begun testing and stopped
  - Reloading CD-Keys will clear all pending CD-Keys to test, ensuring no doubles are tested
  - On loading CD-Keys and proxies, if unable to completely use all sockets due to the
    amount of CD-Keys or proxies, Maelstrom will not modify the socket value, but
    display how many sockets are usable and ignore the other sockets
  - The Dead Sockets label is now known as Available Sockets and shows all the sockets
    currently available for testing
  - CD-Keys past 32,767 can now actually be tested (fully fixed)
  - The loop count feature has now been removed. Instead Maelstrom will connect 1 proxy at
    a time, connecting no more sockets to a proxy than the sockets per proxy value and when
    a proxy fails, it has to fail as many times as the sockets per proxy setting before
    it is removed
  - Tweaked the main GUI around a bit
    - Removed the connections attempted, current proxies alive, dead sockets, and loop
      count and added testing percentage, time elapsed, and CD-Keys per second to the GUI
    - Since time elapsed and CD-Keys per second are now on the main GUI, the benchmarking
      window and its config value have been removed
    - Themed the information on the right side of the text box the same as the information
      on the top
  - When saving CD-Keys back to the CD-Key files, Maelstrom will now only save the CD-Keys
    for products that were actually loaded
  - Fixed some elements on the main form from not being able to move the GUI by clicking
    and dragging the mouse around
  - Added a config GUI, removing the need for several different input boxes, having a
    better way of editing the config and a better solution to checking for errors
  - Maelstrom cannot start with an invalid config
  - Added "Reload Proxies", "Reload CD-Keys" and "Config" to the main form
  - Improved several areas of Maelstrom for performance
  - When testing, the buttons on the bottom right are disabled instead of displaying a message
    stating they are unavailable
  - When testing expansion CD-Keys the count of both expansion and the regular CD-Key will
    be accurate once the regular CD-Key is no longer used
  - Fixed some inconsistencies while testing expansion keys, potentially fixing an
    issue where testing expansion keys would put the regular key in the wrong result file
  - CD-Keys for "other product" were not saved properly
  - Maelstrom will remove multiple IP addresses of the same proxy it finds when loading all
    the proxies, regardless of protocol type
  - Added option to remove bad proxies when closing Maelstrom
  - Maelstrom can now create accounts that don't exist
  - The feature to add date to tested was incorrect
    - Old: \Tested Keys\StarCraft\2016-7-10
    - New: \Tested Keys\2016-7-10\StarCraft
    - Dates are now formatted as MMMM D, YYYY (Example: August 1, 2016)
  - The main window will load up before any errors are processed
  - It is no longer possible to set the server to a non-Battle.Net server

  - Changed the messages for Warcraft III and non-Warcraft III account creation messages to
    use the correct Battle.Net realm notation (Created the Account <Account>@<Realm>)
  - Added missing messages for when an original key is used to test expansion keys
  - Color coded the message for when a muted, voided or jailed original key is used
    to test expansion keys
  - If Maelstrom cannot contact the Battle.Net servers while loading, it will be closed
  - Added CD-Key Profiles as an option
    - Saves keys tested under \CD-Key Profiles\<profile name>\
    - Option to add the current realm to the profile (<profile name> @ USWest for example)
  - CD-Key loading changes
    - Renamed the folder "CDKeys" to "CD-Keys"
    - Invalid keys are no longer reported for specific products, instead how many total
      CD-Keys were invalid when loading
    - The amount of duplicate CD-Keys removed will now be reported
    - Unreadable CD-keys are reported (key is not alphanumeric)
    - Warcraft III/TFT CD-Keys will now be validated (previously they were not)
    - Any key may be placed into the standard CD-Key files (STAR.txt, W2BN.txt, etc.)
      and Maelstrom will load it based on its product
    - Maelstrom can now load CD-Keys from any file
      - Place the files in the \CD-Keys\ folder (they can be inside folders as well)
      - The folders/files in this folder will be wiped after the keys are loaded except the
        standard key files (STAR.txt, W2BN.txt, D2DV.txt, D2XP.txt, WAR3.txt, W3XP.txt)
  - SOCKS5.txt is no longer generated (broken implementation disabled)

  - Removed some possible overhead from the perfect key routine PerfectKeyEvaluation()
  - Removed possible bloating from Maelstrom
  - Removed all variables no longer being used
  - Changed the routine of how regular keys are held while testing expansion keys
  - Upon a config loading error, the Auth key, and the username to the key are recovered as
    well if they were entered in the config

    - For example: STARVerByte=0E (If the byte were to change to 0x0E)
  - Using the Config type to store the Version Bytes
  - Using a dictionary to hold the state of each voided/muted/jailed key while testing perfect
    keys, so its state is remembered when removing the key
  - Minimize to tray is now implemented, and modified a label name (pbQuit for the
    quit button)

Version 3.0 - Released on February 25, 2011

  - Another major overhaul (Now using modBNLS for packet handling, and Types for BNCS data)
    (This may reduce bloating on a grand scale)
  - Muted keys are no longer reported as perfect keys (which would report a blank muted key
    sometimes, thanks Anti-Liberal)
  - Now using SID_NEWS for reporting Perfect, Voided, Muted, and Jailed keys (It's much more
    accurate) (Maelstrom still allows accounts to join BNET channels, but this isn't used
    to check for perfect keys)
  - Fixed an issue where a connection to the auth server remained active, and an interruption
    would return "Unable to check for auth! This program will now close." in the middle
    of testing
  - All keys are now read in as uppercase, to prevent any duplicate keys from being reported
  - Minor GUI edits, showing connection attempts as well as proxy deaths
  - Changed the routine of how proxy deaths are reported
  - Removed two config entries: "Keep_Online" and "ReportNonEXPKeys"
  - clanmage.phost.ws expired, so i had to change the location of the auth server

  - Modified how keys are saved using Opal's style of key saving
    - Uses this format: Tested Keys\<Product Name>\<Key state>.txt
    - Key state falls under the following values:
      - Perfect, In User, Jailed, Muted, Voided, Banned, Other and Invalid
  - Took out the loading of the SortKeys config entry, it had no use
  - Expansion key testing is now possible, although buggy
  - "Good" keys has been renamed to "Perfect" keys, updating the GUI as well (thanks
    Anti-Liberal)
  - Changed the procedure to hand out proxies to sockets, getting rid of a method that used
    loops to hand them out
  - Loop feature now works
  - Will modify the socket count if you're testing less keys than you have sockets for
    this applies to proxies too
  - Improved the speed of the status of connecting initial sockets
  - Perfect keys add to total keys tested per proxy. Made a mistake, and didn't account for
    that before
  - Removed the config variable "LoopTillDead"
  - If the TimesToLoopList variable is 0 or below, it is automatically corrected to 1
  - Two GUI edits:
    - Swapped the position of "other product" and "invalid" keys (thanks Anti-Liberal)
    - Modified the result color of each tested key to match the color on the labels for
      each key state (thanks Anti-Liberal)
  - Will reload CD-Keys if you change the socket value in the config, then hit "Reload."
  - Removed some overhead in S>C 0x50 handler
  - Renamed some constants to reflect "Perfect" instead of "Good" keys
  - Modified the way in which keys are withheld until expansion testing is done

Version 2.0 - Released on December 5, 2010

  - Alt+F4 handling has been implemented (not available natively without a default toolbar)
  - Added HTTP proxy functionality
  - Major, major overhaul (I stripped the user controls out, and replaced them with classes)
  - Used SID_NEWS along with the EID_CHANNELJOIN event to report keys able to log onto
    battle.net with
  - Used a Long to handle every index associated with keys (This allows you to test more
    than 32,767 keys)
  - Sprnkled FreeMemory calls all around the application to prevent bloating

Version 1.0 - Released on November 21, 2010

  - This allows you to move the forum by grabbing any part of the GUI and moving it around
    with the mouse
  - This tester is built off of PunK's BNHash connection library using user controls
    for sockets
  - This used the default menubar used in VB6 (later removed in 1.0)
  - Could test CD-Keys, but not a very good job at it
  - Later revisions didn't use the standard toolbar, and adopted a look
    suitable for the GUI
  - What's funny is this version got leaked on d3scene, but I got the link removed
    (The topic is still up though)
